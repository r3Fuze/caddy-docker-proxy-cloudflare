# caddy-docker-proxy-cloudflare

A custom Caddy build with the [Caddy Docker Proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) and [Cloudflare](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare) modules installed.

Published on the GitHub Container Registry.

This is mostly for personal use, and it does not update automatically when new releases of Caddy or the modules come out.
